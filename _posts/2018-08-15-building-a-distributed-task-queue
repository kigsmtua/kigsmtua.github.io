> A distributed task queue supporting priorities and time based exection based on redis. Named after the famous milau bridge (yes architecture fascinates me)

Milau aims to achieve the following queue recipe
> 1. Distributed task execution
> 2. Highly concurrent
> 3. At-least-once delivery semantics
> 4. No strict FIFO
> 5. Delayed queue (message is not taken out of the queue until some time in the future)

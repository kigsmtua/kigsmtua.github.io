**Is it really agile ?**
This just jots down some ideas on what I consider to be a development workflow setup for success in an environment that claims to be agile. To be fair to everyone, I am no expert in matters agile and all this is from the take of a developers mindset.

I look to answer the following questions
1. Is it really agile if we release and test once in a bluemoon yet we run sprints and the whole Agile ceremonies
2. Is automation really a hinderance to good practices?
3. Devops is really a culture ?
4. Productivity vs effectiveness why most agile perfomance metrics are wrong
